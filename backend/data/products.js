      'Pronounced "La-froyg", this pungent malt punches you in the nose with earthy peat smoke, fresh seaweed and nutty barley. The assault continues with a wallop of salty peat right in the mouth. It isnt all aggressive though as theres a beautiful mellow sweetness in there too. For a long time a little group of committed islanders have worked here to make what is thought to be the most particular single malt on the planet. Obviously after some time the general population change, yet our conventional techniques, the antiquated abilities and outright commitment to quality dependably remains.',
